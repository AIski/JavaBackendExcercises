//    Write a method that takes a field for well-known board game "Battleship"
//    as an argument and returns true if it has a valid disposition of ships,
//            false otherwise. Argument is guaranteed to be 10*10 two-dimension array.
//    Elements in the array are numbers, 0 if the cell is free and 1 if occupied by ship.

//    There must be single battleship (size of 4 cells), 2 cruisers (size 3),
//    3 destroyers (size 2) and 4 submarines (size 1).
//    Any additional ships are not allowed, as well as missing ships.
//    The ship cannot overlap, but can be contact with any other ship.
